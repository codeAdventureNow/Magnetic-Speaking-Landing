# Magnetic Speaking Landing Page :microphone:
<br>
This was my first professional project. It provided me with invaluable experience in leveraging a company's branding assets to create a responsive ad that aligned with their marketing objectives. The implementation of Google Ads alongside the landing page resulted in a substantial surge in lead generation for the company.

"I highly recommend Nate for any front-end web dev project. Nate coded an on-brand landing page for our Google AdWords initiative. Conversion increased by 100% from the previous landing page. Because of the innovative design element of capturing emails before prompting the appointment schedule, we captured and re-engaged potential clients who would have abandoned the process without us knowing about them."
